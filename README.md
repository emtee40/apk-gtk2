# apk-gtk

This is a Gtk+ frontend to apk(1) for the transaction-related commands
(add, del, fix, update, upgrade).

It is meant to be used with other tools to provide a full package
management GUI.

Right now, gtk2 is used because the main Alpine desktop is gtk2, but in theory
the code should build against gtk3 and vte3 as well.
